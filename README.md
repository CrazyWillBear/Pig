# Pig

## Summary
Pig (Package Installer for Git) is a Git repo installer. Essentially, you run `pig install CrazyWillBear/Pig` and it will install it (not just clone, but check for how to compile and install and do so accordinly). It is in the VERY early stages of development and as of now can only install packages containing a Makefile with an install function included.
